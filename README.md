## :memo: How to use?

- **`git clone https://github.com/ebnersilva/fullcycle-desafio-docker-go`**
- **`ðŸ˜„ enjoy ðŸ˜„`**

## :rocket: About the challenge

This challenge is very exciting especially if you have never worked with the Go language!
You will have to publish an image to the docker hub. When we run:

docker run <your-dockerhub-user>/codeeducation

We have to have the following result: Code.education Rocks!

If you notice, this image only performs a print of the message as a final result, so it's worth checking out Go Lang's own website to learn how to make a "hello world".

Remembering that Go Lang has official images ready, it is worth consulting the Docker Hub.

3) The image of our Go project needs to be less than 2MB =)

Tip: In the introduction video about Docker when we talk about the layered file system, I present a "root" image, it might be a good use of it.

Have fun

## :memo: Technologies
